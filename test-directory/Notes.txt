Notes:

General stuff:
• If seeing anything of interest in code or on docs or anything, let Corey or others know and maybe I can work on that.



Work:

• Maybe work with Thane on the ADC for the battery sensing on Bobcat Raven?
	• Create CLI command?
	• CLIExample.cpp
	• Create command to read GPIO ADC pins

• Learning on CMake?

• Tera Term
• Docklite Scripting in owncloud in eng/software/  Grab zip and liscense


• Branch off master to adc_testing
